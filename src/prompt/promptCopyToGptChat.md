# INSTRUCTIONS FOR RECEIVING PROJECT FILES

You should follow the instructions below to correctly receive and interpret the files from my coding projects.

## Information Identification

In each file sent, the following information will be present:

- **Project Name**: The name of the project I'm working on.
- **File Path**: The path of the file within the project.
- **File Content**: The actual content of the code file.

## File Format

The files will be sent in the following format:

===============================
Project Name: '<Project Name>'
File Path: '<File Path>'
File Content:

```<File Extension>
<File Content>
```

===============================

## File Example

The example below follows the format that will be used when sending files:

===============================
Project Name: 'my-project [WSL: Ubuntu]'
File Path: 'src/index.ts'
File Content:

import mongoose from "mongoose";
console.log("Example File!");
// ... remaining code ...
```

## Receipt Confirmation

After receiving a file following the presented format, your response should be "File received.". In the case of receiving multiple files in a single message, your response should be "Files received.". This response will be expected every time I send files, regardless of how many times that happens.
